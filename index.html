  <h1>Interactive Data Visualisations — CPI & Global Cyclones</h1>

  <section class="chart-card intro-card">

      <h2>Domain and Purpose of Visualisation</h2>
      <p>
        The domain of this project focuses on <strong>cost of living and inflation trends</strong> in Australia,
        as reflected by the <em>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</em>. Rising household expenses have broad implications
        for economic well-being, policy design, and affordability across Australian capital cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dataset comes from the <strong>Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</strong> —
        <em>Consumer Price Index, Australia, June Quarter 2025</em> — which provides detailed CPI measures
        for both overall and category-specific expenditure groups across major cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This dashboard combines multiple visualisation types — bar, heatmap, radial, scatter, line, and geospatial —
        to highlight inflation dynamics, category drivers, and broader climate-economic contexts.
        The aim is to create an interactive narrative that supports
        <strong>exploration, comparison, and insight discovery</strong>.

      <h2>How do CPI changes vary across Australia’s capital cities?</h2>
      <p>
        The bar chart highlights that <span class="highlight">Perth</span> recorded the <span class="highlight">highest quarterly CPI increase of 1.9%</span>,
        indicating stronger inflationary pressure than other cities. In contrast, <span class="highlight">Canberra</span> and <span class="highlight">Darwin</span>
        show minimal growth, reflecting more stable consumer prices. The difference in CPI across cities underlines
        the varied cost-of-living pressures Australians face based on geographic location.

      <h2>Which categories contributed most to CPI change?</h2>
      <p>
        Across expenditure groups, <span class="highlight">Housing</span> and <span class="highlight">Food & Non-Alcoholic Beverages</span> dominate CPI increases,
        reflecting rising rents and grocery prices. Meanwhile, <span class="highlight">Clothing & Footwear</span> also contributed notably
        with seasonal demand spikes. The analysis reveals that core living costs — shelter and essentials — are driving the
        <span class="highlight">overall inflation rate above 3.5%</span> in several cities.

      <h2>Which expenditure categories are most inflationary across most cities?</h2>
      <p>
        The heatmap reveals clear regional inflation clusters. <span class="highlight">Housing</span> and <span class="highlight">Transport</span> show consistently
        darker shades — signalling steep price increases across all capitals. Conversely, <span class="highlight">Communication</span> and <span class="highlight">Education</span>
        remain lighter, meaning stable or declining costs. The visual emphasises how housing and mobility remain the biggest contributors to
        <span class="highlight">nationwide CPI acceleration</span>.

      <h2>Which expenditure groups contributed the most to CPI change?</h2>
      <p>
        This radial chart visually communicates the proportional weight of each CPI group. <span class="highlight">Housing</span> alone accounts for
        nearly <span class="highlight">30% of total CPI variation</span>, followed by <span class="highlight">Food</span> and <span class="highlight">Transport</span>.
        Together, these three categories shape the majority of price volatility in the Australian economy, underscoring how essential goods
        directly amplify consumer cost burdens.

      <h2>How does Sydney’s CPI change compare to the national average?</h2>
      <p>
        The scatterplot compares <span class="highlight">Sydney’s CPI group changes</span> against the <span class="highlight">weighted average of eight capital cities</span>.
        For most categories, Sydney sits <span class="highlight">below the national average by 0.3–0.5%</span>, indicating milder inflation pressure relative to peers.
        However, <span class="highlight">Housing</span> and <span class="highlight">Health</span> still show significant positive deviations, reflecting urban rent and service cost surges.

      <h2>Which cities experienced the most extreme CPI changes in specific groups?</h2>
      <p>
        The parallel coordinates plot shows that <span class="highlight">Housing</span> remains a volatile driver across all cities, especially in
        <span class="highlight">Perth</span> and <span class="highlight">Brisbane</span>, where price spikes exceed <span class="highlight">2.0%</span>.
        <span class="highlight">Health</span> and <span class="highlight">Transport</span> also fluctuate heavily between regions,
        suggesting localised supply chain impacts and differing state-level price policies.

      <h2>Where in the world are tropical cyclones most frequent?</h2>
      <p>
        The cyclone map illustrates global storm density for the last 3 years. The <span class="highlight">Western Pacific</span> and <span class="highlight">North Atlantic</span>
        basins show the highest storm frequencies, with wind speeds surpassing <span class="highlight">150 knots</span>. These climatic disruptions
        highlight potential links between <span class="highlight">extreme weather events</span> and regional inflation patterns,
        especially in sectors like <span class="highlight">transport</span> and <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, inflationary patterns remain <span class="highlight">uneven across Australia</span>, with cities like
        <span class="highlight">Perth</span> and <span class="highlight">Brisbane</span> leading CPI growth while <span class="highlight">Canberra</span> lags behind.
        <span class="highlight">Housing, Food, and Transport</span> are confirmed as dominant inflation engines, aligning with national policy concerns.
        The combined view of economic and climatic data provides a holistic picture of how environmental and supply factors reinforce inflation risks.
